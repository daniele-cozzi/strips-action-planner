# STRIPS-Based Action Planning for an Automated Warehouse

This repository presents an **Artificial Intelligence (AI) case study** focused on **action planning** for an **automated warehouse**. It is based on the **STRIPS (Stanford Research Institute Problem Solver) model**, a well-known planning approach in AI.

This project was developed as part of the **Artificial Intelligence course**, a discipline within the **Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Computer Engineering at Politecnico di Milano**.

## Case Study Overview

The project models an **intelligent agent** (robot) that interacts with an **automated warehouse environment** and plans its actions **rationally** to achieve a specific goal: delivering packages to designated exit zones. 

Using **formal action representation**, this system applies fundamental principles of **AI planning**, including:
- **Action preconditions and effects**
- **Sequential action planning**
- **Goal-oriented behavior**
- **Task automation and execution**
